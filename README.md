## 🔹 About Me  

I am a final-year engineering student with a strong, hands-on foundation in **Python, Statistics, SQL, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. I follow a structured, concept-first learning approach where every topic is practiced using real datasets and clean Jupyter notebooks.  

I strongly believe in **learning by doing**, and I regularly push my practice work and mini-projects to GitHub in an organized manner.
